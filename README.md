# pInetd

Fourth evolution of pInetd, this time written in C++ and based on Qt

# History

pInetd is initially a PHP daemon allowing to easily write and run network
daemons for various purposes. Since its original version zero as a wrapper
for xinetd, it evolved into a daemon of its own when taking the name pinetd.

pinetd2 goes further by having a more object-oriented structure and processes
for each daemon.

pinetd3 was the first attempt to rewrite pinetd in C by using PHP's engine to
run the daemons, but it failed.

This new evolution aims at solving the previous problems by adopting a fully
modular infrastructure (TODO: insert more bullshit here).
